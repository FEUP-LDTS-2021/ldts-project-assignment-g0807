# LDTS_T08_G07 - Jetpack Joyride

## Game Description

This project is based on the popular Android game Jetpack Joyride where the player, who has just stolen a jetpack, needs to escape from a laboratory. To achieve that, the player needs to dodge from obstacles like lasers and missiles. The game has no levels: the objective is to survive the longest distance and collect the largest amount of coins.
