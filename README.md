# LDTS_T08_G07 - Jetpack Joyride

## Game Description

This project is based on the popular Android game Jetpack Joyride where the player, who has just stolen a jetpack, needs to escape from a laboratory. To achieve that, the player needs to dodge from obstacles like lasers and missiles. The game has no levels: the objective is to survive the longest time.

## Implemented Features

- **Player movement**: when the space bar is pressed, the player moves to one unit higher and when there is no input from the user, the player starts to fall
- **Obstacles**: As the game progresses, the obstacles (lasers and missiles) are generated randomly

## Planned Features

- **Coins**: The map will have coins spread through the map that can be caught by the player
- **Menu**: A menu to start the game or to quit
- **Reset**: The player will have a chance to replay the game when it looses
- **Distance and Coins Counter**: There will be a counter to inform the player of the coins it has collected so far and the distance it has travelled
